Linked List -> A data structure that stores values and the reference of another node. help to have a dynamic and easier memory allocation.

Utilizes more in complex data structures graphs, binary search trees etc.

Flexibility to grow, can have different data type values stored into nodes,resolves the limitation of memory allocation of array.


Question - How to create a linkedlist in python? 
Answer - Create a Class Node then have a two properties into the Node constuctor One is key or considered as values nother is the node instence it self.

Class Node:

    __init__(self,key):
        self.key = key
        self.nextNode = None

    

Node temp1 = new Node(5)
Node temp2 = new Node(6)
Node temp3 = new Node(8)


temp1.nextNode = temp2
temp2.nextNode = temp3
temp3.nextNode = null


head = temp1

print(head.key) = 5
print(head.nextNode.key) = 6
print(head.nextNode.nextNode.key) = 8
